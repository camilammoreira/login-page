# Simulated Login Project

This is a simple login page project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) public API to simulate user authentication. The login validation is handled on the frontend for demonstration purposes.

## 💡 Purpose

To demonstrate how to create a login form that sends data to a REST API using `fetch`, handles the response, and redirects the user upon successful authentication.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- [ReqRes API](https://reqres.in/)

## 🔐 How It Works

The ReqRes API accepts a valid email and **any password** and returns a token. However, to simulate a real login process, this project includes hardcoded password **before** sending the request to the API.

### Valid Credentials
```text
Email: eve.holt@reqres.in
Password: <inputed by user>
